# SDL Game with C++

The plan is to make a game based on Financial Mathematics using SDL2. The game should focus on various topics including
- Income (wages, salary)
- Paying tax
- Simple Interest
- Compound Interest
- Deprecation
- Investments and loans

These topics are based on the NSW Year 10 Maths 5.2 Syllabus
